    <p>This recipe has all the spirits including vodka, gin, tequila, and white rum. Meanwhile, a splash of triple sec, simple syrup, and cola sweeten the deal.
While you may have heard it’s not a good idea to mix this many liquors, it’s all too good in this iced tea. 
Speaking of which, you’re probably wondering about the iced tea.
The name is a bit of a misnomer because iced tea refers to the color of the drink, not an ingredient.
